# Github Error Dialog

This is a tiny library that shows a tiny and ugly error dialog which tells the user
that something has gone wrong, displaying the error message and optionally showing
a `Reoirt issue on GitHub` link. The link contains a prefilled issue template, if
this isn't wanted, simply disable it.
